INSERT INTO `product` VALUES (1,'Debit Card','Point of Sale (POS) GlossaryPoint of Sale (POS) Glossary\nA debit transaction is a point of sale purchase that is processed using a bank card linked to a checking account. Unlike a credit transaction, a debit transaction usually requires that the customer have the money available in their bank account to cover the transaction.\n\nDebit transactions are similar to checks in that they work against a checking account balance instead of credit. A debit card transaction may allow a customer to simultaneously make a cash withdrawal from their account and then receive the money from the merchant.\n\nA POS terminal may prompt the customer for a secret personal identification number (PIN) for debit transactions or withdrawals. The use of a PIN depends on the conditions of the card and merchant preferences. Debit cards can also usually be used at an automatic teller machine (ATM) to access a customerâ€™s bank account.','https://www.shutterstock.com/image-illustration/debit-card-isolated-on-white-260nw-542784994.jpg',12,0.21,7),(2,'Saving Accounts','Description:\nSavings accounts are deposit accounts held by individuals at banks or credit unions.\nThey are designed to store funds securely while earning interest on the deposited money.\nSavings accounts are typically liquid, meaning the funds can be easily accessed when needed, though there may be restrictions on the number of withdrawals allowed per month.\nFeatures:\nInterest Earnings: Savings accounts accrue interest on the deposited funds, with the interest rate varying depending on the bank and prevailing market rates.\nAccessibility: Funds in savings accounts can be accessed through various channels, including ATMs, online banking, mobile apps, and in-person visits to bank branches.\nSafety: Savings accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in the United States or similar agencies in other countries, providing protection for deposits up to a certain limit (e.g., $250,000 in the U.S.).\nNo Risk of Loss: Unlike investments in stocks or other securities, savings accounts are considered low-risk because the principal amount is typically not subject to market fluctuations.\nNo Expiry Date: Savings accounts do not have an expiration date, so the funds can remain in the account indefinitely, allowing individuals to save for short-term or long-term goals.\nBenefits:\nEmergency Fund: Savings accounts provide a safe place to store funds for unexpected expenses or emergencies, offering financial security and peace of mind.\nShort-Term Goals: Individuals use savings accounts to save for short-term goals such as vacations, home renovations, or purchasing big-ticket items.\nInterest Income: Earning interest on savings can help individuals grow their wealth over time, providing a source of passive income.\nEasy Access: Unlike some other types of investments, funds in savings accounts are readily accessible, making them suitable for funds needed in the near future.\nFees and Requirements:\nMinimum Balance: Some savings accounts may require a minimum balance to open the account or avoid monthly maintenance fees.\nMonthly Maintenance Fees: Some banks charge monthly fees if certain balance requirements are not met or if the account does not meet specific criteria.\nWithdrawal Limits: Federal regulations in the U.S. limit the number of certain types of withdrawals or transfers from savings accounts to six per month, though this limit may vary by country and financial institution.\nTypes of Savings Accounts:\nBasic Savings Account: Offers a simple account structure with competitive interest rates and easy access to funds.\nHigh-Yield Savings Account: Typically offers higher interest rates than basic savings accounts, often with higher minimum balance requirements.\nMoney Market Account: Combines features of savings and checking accounts, offering higher interest rates and check-writing privileges but may have higher minimum balance requirements.\nCertificates of Deposit (CDs): Time-based savings accounts with fixed terms and interest rates, typically offering higher rates than regular savings accounts but with penalties for early withdrawals.\nOnline Savings Accounts:\nOnline banks often offer savings accounts with competitive interest rates and minimal fees, as they have lower overhead costs compared to traditional brick-and-mortar banks.','https://www.nj.com/personal-finance/static/53a4e3dff0e918cc1de8f39c5b99adac/f61e6/types-of-savings-accounts.webp',2,0.21,3),(3,'Personal Loan','Description:\nPersonal loans are unsecured loans provided to individuals by banks, credit unions, or online lenders.\nThey are typically used for purposes such as debt consolidation, home improvements, medical expenses, vacations, or other major purchases.\nUnlike secured loans (e.g., auto loans or mortgages), personal loans do not require collateral, but approval is based on the borrowers creditworthiness and income.Features:Loan Amount: Personal loans can range from a few hundred dollars to tens of thousands of dollars, depending on the lender and the borrowers financial situation.\nInterest Rate: Personal loan interest rates can be fixed (remain the same throughout the loan term) or variable (may change based on market conditions).\nTerm: The repayment term for personal loans typically ranges from one to seven years, with monthly payments spread out over the term.\nCredit Check: Most lenders perform a credit check to assess the borrowers creditworthiness, though there are options available for individuals with less-than-perfect credit.Fees: Some personal loans may have origination fees, late payment fees, or prepayment penalties, so its essential to understand the fee structure before taking out a loan.Application Process:Individuals can apply for personal loans online, through banks, credit unions, or other financial institutions.\nThe application process typically involves submitting personal and financial information, such as income, employment history, and credit score.\nLenders may also require documentation such as pay stubs, bank statements, or tax returns to verify income and employment.\nBenefits:\nDebt Consolidation: Personal loans can be used to consolidate high-interest debt into a single, more manageable payment, potentially saving money on interest.\nFlexibility: Borrowers can use personal loans for a variety of purposes, providing flexibility to address different financial needs.\nFixed Payments: With fixed interest rates and fixed monthly payments, personal loans offer predictability and stability, making budgeting easier.\nQuick Access to Funds: Once approved, funds from personal loans are typically disbursed quickly, allowing borrowers to address their financial needs promptly.\nConsiderations:\nCredit Score: Borrowers with higher credit scores typically qualify for lower interest rates and better loan terms, so its essential to maintain good credit.\nAffordability: Before taking out a personal loan, borrowers should consider whether they can afford the monthly payments and if the loan is the best option for their financial situation.\nRepayment Schedule: Borrowers should understand the repayment schedule, including the total amount to be repaid and the duration of the loan term.\nInterest Rates: Its crucial to compare interest rates from multiple lenders to ensure the borrower gets the best possible rate and terms.','https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2024-03/19/full/1710817465-1851.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,size=(826,465)',4,0.10,1),(4,'Credit Cards','Description:\nCorporate credit

software, allowing for seamless expense tracking, reporting, and reconciliation.\nRewards and Incentives: Some corporate credit cards offer rewards programs, cashback incentives, or other benefits for business-related spending.\nBenefits:\nConvenience: Corporate credit cards provide a convenient way for employees to make purchases and manage business expenses without using personal funds or going through a reimbursement process.\nCash Flow Management: By using corporate credit cards, businesses can manage cash flow more effectively by delaying payment until the end of the billing cycle.\nExpense Control: Companies can set spending limits, monitor transactions in real-time, and enforce spending policies to control costs and prevent misuse.\nStreamlined Reporting: Corporate credit card programs offer detailed transaction data and reporting tools, making it easier for businesses to track expenses, analyze spending patterns, and generate financial reports.\nFees and Requirements:\nAnnual Fees: Many corporate credit cards charge annual fees, though some may waive the fee for the first year or offer fee waivers based on spending volume.\nInterest Rates: Corporate credit cards may have variable interest rates based on market conditions and the creditworthiness of the business.\nAdditional Cardholder Fees: Some programs charge fees for each additional card issued to employees or departments within the organization.\nLate Payment Fees: Companies may incur late payment fees if they fail to pay the credit card balance by the due date.\nLimitations:\nCredit Limits: Corporate credit cards have credit limits, so businesses must manage spending within these limits to avoid declined transactions or over-limit fees.\nRisk of Misuse: Without proper controls and monitoring, corporate credit cards can be vulnerable to misuse, fraud, or unauthorized spending.\nInterest Charges: If businesses carry a balance on their corporate credit cards, they may incur interest charges, which can add to the cost of using credit.\nTypes of Corporate Credit Cards:\nCompany Credit Cards: Issued in the companys name and used by authorized employees for business expenses.\nPurchasing Cards (P-Cards): Designed specifically for purchasing goods and services, often with restricted merchant categories and spending controls.\nTravel Cards: Geared toward business travel expenses such as flights, hotels, and rental cars, often offering travel-related perks and benefits.','https://navi.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/credit-card.jpg',5,0.10,8),(5,'Current

financial institutions.\nFeatures:\nDeposits and Withdrawals: Businesses can deposit funds into their current account through various channels, including cash, checks, electronic transfers, and direct
