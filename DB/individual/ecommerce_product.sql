INSERT INTO `product` VALUES (1,'Debit Card','Point of Sale (POS) GlossaryPoint of Sale (POS) Glossary\nA debit transaction is a point of sale purchase that is processed using a bank card linked to a checking account. Unlike a credit transaction, a debit transaction usually requires that the customer have the money available in their bank account to cover the transaction.\n\nDebit transactions are similar to checks in that they work against a checking account balance instead of credit. A debit card transaction may allow a customer to simultaneously make a cash withdrawal from their account and then receive the money from the merchant.\n\nA POS terminal may prompt the customer for a secret personal identification number (PIN) for debit transactions or withdrawals. The use of a PIN depends on the conditions of the card and merchant preferences. Debit cards can also usually be used at an automatic teller machine (ATM) to access a customerâ€™s bank account.','https://www.shutterstock.com/image-illustration/debit-card-isolated-on-white-260nw-542784994.jpg',12,0.21,7),(2,'Saving Accounts','Description:\nSavings accounts are deposit accounts held by individuals at banks or credit unions.\nThey are designed to store funds securely while earning interest on the deposited money.\nSavings accounts are typically liquid, meaning the funds can be easily accessed when needed, though there may be restrictions on the number of withdrawals allowed per month.\nFeatures:\nInterest Earnings: Savings accounts accrue interest on the deposited funds, with the interest rate varying depending on the bank and prevailing market rates.\nAccessibility: Funds in savings accounts can be accessed through various channels, including ATMs, online banking, mobile apps, and in-person visits to bank branches.\nSafety: Savings accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in the United States or similar agencies in other countries, providing protection for deposits up to a certain limit (e.g., $250,000 in the U.S.).\nNo Risk of Loss: Unlike investments in stocks or other securities, savings accounts are considered low-risk because the principal amount is typically not subject to market fluctuations.\nNo Expiry Date: Savings accounts do not have an expiration date, so the funds can remain in the account indefinitely, allowing individuals to save for short-term or long-term goals.\nBenefits:\nEmergency Fund: Savings accounts provide a safe place to store funds for unexpected expenses or emergencies, offering financial security and peace of mind.\nShort-Term Goals: Individuals use savings accounts to save for short-term goals such as vacations, home renovations, or purchasing big-ticket items.\nInterest Income: Earning interest on savings can help individuals grow their wealth over time, providing a source of passive income.\nEasy Access: Unlike some other types of investments, funds in savings accounts are readily accessible, making them suitable for funds needed in the near future.\nFees and Requirements:\nMinimum Balance: Some savings accounts may require a minimum balance to open the account or avoid monthly maintenance fees.\nMonthly Maintenance Fees: Some banks charge monthly fees if certain balance requirements are not met or if the account does not meet specific criteria.\nWithdrawal Limits: Federal regulations in the U.S. limit the number of certain types of withdrawals or transfers from savings accounts to six per month, though this limit may vary by country and financial institution.\nTypes of Savings Accounts:\nBasic Savings Account: Offers a simple account structure with competitive interest rates and easy access to funds.\nHigh-Yield Savings Account: Typically offers higher interest rates than basic savings accounts, often with higher minimum balance requirements.\nMoney Market Account: Combines features of savings and checking accounts, offering higher interest rates and check-writing privileges but may have higher minimum balance requirements.\nCertificates of Deposit (CDs): Time-based savings accounts with fixed terms and interest rates, typically offering higher rates than regular savings accounts but with penalties for early withdrawals.\nOnline Savings Accounts:\nOnline banks often offer savings accounts with competitive interest rates and minimal fees, as they have lower overhead costs compared to traditional brick-and-mortar banks.','https://www.nj.com/personal-finance/static/53a4e3dff0e918cc1de8f39c5b99adac/f61e6/types-of-savings-accounts.webp',2,0.21,3),(5,'Current account','Description:\nA current account, also known as a checking account or transaction account, is a type of bank account that businesses use for their daily banking needs.\nIt allows businesses to deposit and withdraw funds as needed, make payments to suppliers, employees, and other parties, and manage cash flow effectively.\nCurrent accounts may be held at banks, credit unions, or other financial institutions.\nFeatures:\nDeposits and Withdrawals: Businesses can deposit funds into their current account through various channels, including cash, checks, electronic transfers, and direct deposits.
